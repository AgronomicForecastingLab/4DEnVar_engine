# 4DEnVar_engine

Implements a 4DEnVar solver, as described in [Pinnington et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-55-2020).
The contents of 4DEnVar.c are an example interface only (i.e. this should be adapted to your own problem). 
The core tools for solving the data assimilation problem are in the file 4DEnVar_engine.c.
