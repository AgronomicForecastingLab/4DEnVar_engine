* Read in h(x_b) separately - i.e. non linear obs operator applied to x_b
  -> DONE. Needs some experiments to check impact. 
* Calculate full posterior
  -> DONE. Resolved some problems with original algorithm.

* Pass options for tolerances, max iterations and so on
* Test inverse square root of matrix is performing correctly
